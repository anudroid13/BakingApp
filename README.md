# BakingApp

This project was built under Udacity Nanodegree Program -I. 
It was proposed to develop an app which will run on Android mobile and Android Tablet devices.
The intention was to fetch the list of Recipes from the server and show them as a list in devices and it will also show the ingredients and the videos for the same as the user navigates deep into the app.

As you'll go through the code you'll find few implementations such as Mater-Detail flow, Espresso Tests and Exoplayer to show the videos.

This project uses following third party libraries.
